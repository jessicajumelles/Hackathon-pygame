# CUNY Tech Prep Hackathon, Team GECL‚Äôs Project: <Game Title>

This project is the fruit of Team GECL‚Äôs innovation. For the theme of CUNY Tech Prep‚Äôs 2021 hackathon, ‚Äúback to in-person‚Äù we wanted to create an entertaining game related to social distancing and/or avoiding close contact. This game‚Äôs setting is a subway platform, and the objective is to avoid coming into contact with the random people milling about. There *is* a health counter, so many sure to keep it positive üòâ by keeping away from the COVID positives (the people with the green clouds hanging over their heads).

## How to Run

In order to run this game, you will need Python 3. This game also depends on [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/), so install it first using the `pip` tool.

```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

There are more detailed instructions on installing Pygame on [Pygame‚Äôs Getting Started page](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).

But once that is set up, run the game by typing `python main.py`. Replace `main.py` with the [relative] path to the Python code.

## How to Play

So you‚Äôve got it running? Here‚Äôs how to play:

1. The game will begin by spawning people randomly on the platform (including yourself).
2. Your objective it to keep your distance, so use the arrow keys to help your character navigate the platform.
    a. If you are touch by anyone, you lose a life.
    b. If you manage to dodge them, more will come.
3. Try to stay alive and rack up a high score. üôÇ

Good luck!
